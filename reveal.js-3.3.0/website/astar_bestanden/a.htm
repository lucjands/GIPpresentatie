<p>When trying to compile the code for the first time I notised grid.ts,
 diagram.ts and search.ts are missing. Also when thinking about it I 
think it is probably to time consuming to add all these animations in to
 my javascript presentation in the short timespan I have. But anyway 
thank you very mush for you effort!</p>

<p>Since Dijkstra's visiting the nodes in order of distance, you can 
stop as soon as the head of the priority queue exceeds your range limit.
 Everything in the frontier (priority queue) has to be at least that far
 away, and every unvisited node has to be at least as far as anything in
 the frontier.</p>

<p>Awesome tutorial, Thanks for the pragmatic explanation. By any

 or any path finding algorithms that involve costs and obstacles. I

<p>A* handles costs and obstacles. Simulated Annealing is not something I
 would ever use for pathfinding; it's useful for searching a parameter 
space rather than a game map. I've been writing tutorials for things I 
use myself, and I haven't used Simulated Annealing in games so I don't 
plan to write anything about it. Sorry! I don't know anything about 
MultiLine Layout and wasn't able to find anything on Google.</p>

<p>Yes — A* works on any graph, and a voxel/block world can be viewed as
 a graph the same way a 2d grid can be viewed as a graph (see <a href="http://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/grids/graphs.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>).
 However, for large graphs you will likely need more optimizations, and 
there are a wide variety of possible optimizations for grids. Take a 
look at <a href="http://www.cs.du.edu/%7Esturtevant/papers/GPPC-2014.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.du.edu/~sturteva...</a> for some ideas if you need grid optimizations, or see <a href="http://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/grids/algorithms.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.redblobgames.com/pa...</a> for an overview.</p>

<p>It will add another item. Some people don't like this. I've written more about this topic <a data-tid="841" href="http://simblob.blogspot.com/2014/07/dijkstras-algorithm-and-reprioritizing.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
 Either you can try to replace the existing item, which makes your 
priority queue more complicated (often slower), or you can have another 
item, which makes your priority queue bigger (usually slower). Some 
priority queue data structures do support updating in place, but I am 
using a binary heap, which does not. Either way is fine! I chose to have
 the additional item, because it keeps the code smaller and simpler.</p>

<p>I don't usually take the time to make accounts and comment on 
articles like this, but I just felt I really had to. This is some fine 
work, and explained very concisely, providing just enough information to
 encourage testing and further learning without being bombarded by 
concepts that we'd have to explore to really understand.</p><p>I'm 
looking through some of your other articles now and I'm really liking 
what I'm seeing. Wish I'd found this site a year ago when I'd really 
started my game dev career; would have saved me a decent amount of time!</p><p>Cheers!</p>

<p>I have a question.. How would i be able to implement this algorithm 
in a Tile based platformer game, where jumping have to be accounted for?
 great job on explaining c#! I have already made the the algorithm work 
for regular pathfinding, but cant get it to work in my platformer game i
 have to make for school.</p>

<p>A* works with any graph structure, so you can represent platform jump
 and landing points as graph nodes, and the jumps and falls as graph 
edges. Annotate the graph edges with the type of move, whether it's a 
run/walk or a jump or a fall. That way, when A* returns a path 
P--Q--R--S you can see that the P--Q move is running right, Q--R is 
jumping up, R--S is moving right, etc. You might also take a look at <a href="http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/98090/pathfinding-in-a-2d-sidescrolling-strategy-game" rel="nofollow">this question</a> on stackoverflow.</p>

<p>Excellent work!<br>while every other article jumped straight to 
f(n)=g(n)+h(n) without really explaining what it is, you built the 
problem definition piece by piece, which is the best way to teach 
something.</p><p>Thank you, an amazing article that helped me truly understand the A* and heuristics.</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback! I agree. I'm not happy with the contour 
lines, and wasn't happy with arrows either. I might try a heat map 
instead, or maybe drop those sections entirely. I'm making a list of 
improvements for the next major revision. Another thing I'm not happy 
with is that the diagram at the top of the page uses a grid. A* can and 
is used on non-grid maps, and the grid at the top gives the wrong 
impression.</p>

<p>Thanks! These pages are taking a long time for me to write, so I 
think I won't be able to cover all CS topics. There are people working 
on other topics; check out <a href="https://github.com/enjalot/algovis" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/enjalot/alg...</a> and <a href="http://www.maartenlambrechts.be/the-rise-of-explorable-explanations/" rel="nofollow">http://www.maartenlambrechts.b...</a> . I think it's likely that only certain types of topics are suitable for this style of explanation.</p>

<p>Amazing article. Python's readability helps understand the algorithms. Thanks a lot !<br>On
 dijkstra's implementation what is the benefit of not keeping the nodes 
already visited in a set() and get rid of the cost incurred when 
computing the new_cost ? I understand the different is subtle. If we use
 a visited set we'll need more space but smaller amount of total 
operations.</p>

<p>I've not written games in Javascript and don't know what framework is
 best, but Phaser seems popular. Most of the gamedev I've done is the 
same for any language. You might look at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/wiki/getting_started" rel="nofollow">this</a> if you're getting started writing games.</p>

<p>This is by far the best explanation of the A* algorithm that I have 
read. Crisp, clear and intuitive. I especially liked the way you built 
up  gradually from Greedy BFS and Dijkstra's algorithm. And to top it 
off, the visualizations are quite brilliant. All in all a great job! 
Thanks a ton for all the effort that you've put into writing this.</p>

<p>I loved it, thanks. Can you post more complex algorithms for path 
finding in the future? Like some good local search algorithms such as 
Simulated Annealing or Hill Climbing, but optimized for path finding in 
video games?</p>

<p>There are single-source single-destination graph search algorithms 
like A* but there are also single-source all-destination algorithms like
 Dijkstra's Algorithm and Breadth First Search. If you reverse the edges
 you can run those as multiple-source one-destination algorithms. There 
are also all-source all-destination algorithms like Floyd-Warshall and 
Johnson's Algorithm.</p>
